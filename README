There is a companion project to this project that allows for customers who have checked in a computer using the Computer Check-in System to be
able to look up the status of their computer and leave notes for the tech(s) working on the computer.  The companion project can be found at
https://github.com/mwalles2/Computer-Check-in-System--Customer-.

INSTALLATION
To install this on a new server you will need to make sure that the following directories are writebale by the webserver:

{WEBSERVERROOT}/admin/pdf/
{WEBSERVERROOT}/pdf/

These directories are where the PDF files will be store for checking in and out repairs as well as where the stale computer list will be stored.

To set up the database:

mysql -u yourusername -p yourdatabase < {WEBSERVERROOT}/install/structure.db

CONFIG FILE
The two files that need to set up are:

{WEBSERVERROOT}/includes/php/db.php
{WEBSERVERROOT}/includes/php/ldap_info.php

There are examples of these files in the includes directory.

STATIC PDF
The static PDF folder ({WEBSERVERROOT}/pdf/static/) is where any and all static PDFs are store for printing.  Currently there is only one file
being used this way.  That file is a pricelist that prints on the back of the users copy of the check-in sheet.  The file is named pricelist.pdf

UNL SPECIFIC FILES
There are design files that are specific to UNL (http://www.unl.edu) and the UNL Computer Help Center (http://ischc.unl.edu).  This was a temporary
messure for expedience.  These files will be removed in the future once a system as been built to allow easier customization.
