There is a companion project to this project that allows for customers who have checked in a computer using the Computer Check-in System to be
able to look up the status of their computer and leave notes for the tech(s) working on the computer.  The companion project can be found at
https://github.com/mwalles2/Computer-Check-in-System--Customer-.

INSTALLATION
To install this on a new server you will need to make sure that the following directories are writeable by the web server:

	{WEBSERVERROOT}/admin/pdf/
	{WEBSERVERROOT}/pdf/

These directories are where the PDF files will be store for checking in and out repairs as well as where the stale computer list will be stored.

To set up the database:

	mysql -u yourusername -p yourdatabase < {WEBSERVERROOT}/install/structure.db

CONFIG FILE
The two files that need to set up are:

	{WEBSERVERROOT}/includes/php/db.php
	{WEBSERVERROOT}/includes/php/ldap_info.php

There are examples of these files in the includes directory.

CRON JOBS
There are a few scripts that need to be scheduled to run automatically.  It does not matter when they run.  These scripts are:

Turn Around Information
	{WEBSERVERROOT}/admin/maintenance/update_turn_around-done_date.php
	This will update the estimated turn around in days that is currently displayed on the front page of the Check-in System.

Stale Computer List
	{WEBSERVERROOT}/admin/maintenance/stale_computers_pdf.php
	This will print out all computer that have not had a note added to them in the last four days.  You will also need to set the following
	directory as readable by what ever account is running the command:

		{WEBSERVERROOT}/admin/maintenance/pdf/

Auto Contact
	{WEBSERVERROOT}/admin/maintenance/auto_contact.php
	This will automaticlly contact costumers that wish to be contacted when the status of their computer changes.

Send Survey
	{WEBSERVERROOT}/admin/maintenance/send_survey.php
	This will automaticlly send a survey out to anyone that has picked up their computer the prevoius day.
STATIC PDF
The static PDF folder ({WEBSERVERROOT}/pdf/static/) is where any and all static PDFs are store for printing.  Currently there is only one file
being used this way.  That file is a price list that prints on the back of the users copy of the check-in sheet.  The file is named pricelist.pdf

UNL SPECIFIC FILES
There are design files that are specific to UNL (http://www.unl.edu) and the UNL Computer Help Center (http://ischc.unl.edu).  This was a temporary
measure for expedience.  These files will be removed in the future once a system as been built to allow easier customization.
